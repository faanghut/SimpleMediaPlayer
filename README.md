# Simple Media Player - Android - ExoPlayer
As the title indicates this is a simple audio and video media player for Android. It has been built to demonstrate the audio and video streaming capabilities of ExoPlayer. We make use of Kotlin with viewbinding for implementing this. 

This project makes use of a **LeastRecentlyUsedCacheEvictor** & a **SimpleCache** to cache downloaded media to prevent downloading the content over and over again.  

Detailed implementation guide for this project is available on [Faanghut](https://faanghut.com/implement-a-cache-for-exoplayer/). If you have any questions, please do raise an issue.
